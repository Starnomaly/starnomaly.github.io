## Welcome To My Page!

This is where I'll talk about any sort of projects I might be working on

### About Me

The first language I learned as a kid was Python and since then I have learned much more. Now I also know C# and have a bit of knowledge in HTML and Javascript. Everytime I start a project I always end up learning more and more about each of them.
